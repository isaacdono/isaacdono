## 👋 About Me

🚀 Computer Engineering student at UNICAMP with interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics. Currently enhancing my knowledge as an AI/ML Intern at CPQD, where I work with cutting-edge technologies including Generative AI and Deep Learning.

🤖 As a research fellow at CTI Renato Archer, I developed an advanced robotics project that integrates speech, vision, and locomotion through Generative AI. My technical toolkit includes hands-on experience with PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and LangChain.

🏆 Passionate about rapid prototyping and innovation, I actively participate in hackathons and challenges, such as the NVIDIA AI Agents Bootcamp, UNICAMP Innovation Challenge and RoboLabs by Igus.

💬 I am always open to collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of AI-driven automation and robotics. Let's connect!
